# Use Case
## Narrative
Life expectancy is a measure that reflects the average number of years that a human is expected to live based on a variety of diverse factors. Generally, life expectancy is used to judge the average health of a society.
In addition to genetic predispositions, life expectancy is greatly influenced by a combination of environmental, social, and behavioral influences.
Across the state of Ohio, as in many parts of the United States, significant disparities in life expectancy may exist between different counties, ZIP codes, and even neighborhoods.
This presents an opportunity to better understand and address the root causes of these variations through a data-driven approach.
Our primary objective is to develop a knowledge graph model that estimates life expectancy for residents of all Ohio counties by integrating a wide range of datasets. The model will incorporate environmental data such as water quality and pollution.
These environmental exposures have been directly linked to serious medical issues, such as respiratory issues and various forms of cancer, and all of which negatively affect longevity.
