### Summary
Concepts of the semantic web- enables software agents to understand relationships between data, reason about it , and perform complex tasks automatically on behalf of user.
The semantic web can understand as an extend of website, combine: people, event, idea, product, concept,... These elements will be give "labels" to describe their meaning ==> tightly linkedn together to build a more data-rich website where computers can find, read, and reson about a particular piece of content => a smarter and more seamless user experience journey.
1. Expressing Meaning
   - Web content is enriched with metadata so machines can "understand" relationships, not just texted.
   - Use XML for structure & RDF for encoding meaning in triples(subject-predicate-object)
2. Knowledge presentation
   - Provides structure collections of information and inference rules
   - Reasoning
   - Balances expressiveness and practically
3. Ontologies
   - Share vocabularies defining concepts and relationships between them
   - Enabel interoperability betwwen different databases and systems
   - Allow classification and inference rules to deduce new knowledge
4. Agents
   - Intelligent software programs that retrive, process, and exchange information automatically
   - Can form value chains by passing information between services by adding values at each step
   - Use proofs, digital signatures, and ontologies to verify trust and collaborate flexibility.
   - Agents can find and use services automatically
   - Supported by semantic descriptions instead of regid, predifined standard
5. Integration with the physical world and evolution of knowledge
   - Extend to devices and interact intelligently
   - Encourages small groups to innovate with their own vocabularies and linking into broder shared ontologies
   - Create a universial knowledge network, enabling machines to help evolve and connect human knowledge
  
**TERMINOLOGY**
* RDF(Resource Description Frame work): publish and link data base on: XML and URL + "Three elements" (Subject, Predicate, Object) linked together ==> form a rich Knowledge Base (KnowledgeGraph)
* SPARQL: RDF Query Language and Protocol ~ access data of RDF
* OWL(Ontology Web Language): a logic-based language designed

**6 LAYER** of semantic web architecture:
- Unicode and URI Layer: used in current website platforms
  - Unicode: a standard for encoding all data and languages ==> support accurate information transfer
  - URI(Uniform Resource Identifier): the basis for identifying the location of all website resources, the most common type of is URL(Universal Resource Locator)
- XML, NS and XML Schema Layers: the great basis for integrating. Provides a standard way to express structured information when transfering data between applications.
  - XML: supported by search engines and users. A common syntax for all forms of data representation
- RDF Layer and RDF Schema: this is a semantic website
  - RDF: a language or model for representing semantics or creating simple views to computers
  - RDFS- RDF Vocabulary Description Language: helps enhance the semantic precision of the RDF data model
- Ontology vocabulary layer: Allow for the extension of the vocabulary describing classes and properties precisely when added to RDF and shared widely on the internet. Collection of information call ontology.
- Logic layer: provided suitable bases for RDF metadata to be transformed into knowledge
- Proof layer and Trust Layer


### Questions to Instructor
1. Proof layer and trust layer?
2. Why it take so long for everyone realize the important of semantic web?
