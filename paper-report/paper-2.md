### Summary
The semantic web field  evoled through three main phases:
1. Ontologies (early 2000s): formalized vocabularies and reasoning system
2. Linked data (mid 2000s to early 2010s): emphasis on publishing and interlinking RDF datasets
3. Knowledge Graphs (2012 - nowaday): industry driven, structured data repositories powering applications like Google's Knowledge Graphs, Wikipedia, and Wikidata

Academic contributions (W3C Standards: RDF, OWL, SPARQL) and Industrial adoption (Schema.org, Wikidata,...)

1. Conceptual Foundations:
    - Semantic Web = research field
    - Goals: machine-readble etadata, ontologies, reasoning and intelligent data services
    - Overlaps with AI, database, NLP, IoT, and Knowledge representation
2. Historical:
    * Ontologies(2000s):
      * Share conceptual vocabularies
      * W3C Standards: OWL (2004, 2012), RDF (2004, 2014), SPARQL (2008, 2013)
      * Description logics
    * Linked Data (2006 - 2012)
      * Publishing interlinkd RDF dataset (DBpedia, LOD Cloud)
      * Industry adoption(Facebook, Amazon)
      * Schema.org(2011) standardized web annotations
      * Wikidata(2012) crowdsourced structured knowledge
    * Knowledge Graphs (2012-today)
      * Popularized by Google's Knowledge Graph
      * Widely used in industry (Google, IBM, Microsoft)
      * Shift from open academic projects to industry-led
3. Applications
    * Life science
    * Search engines and digital assistants
    * Knowledge management and integration in enterprises
    * Digital humanities, geosciences, IoT
4. Key technology
    * RDF: Graph-base data model
    * OWL: Ontology language (logic-based)
    * SPARQL: Query language for RDF
    * JSON-LD: light weight linked data format
    * Wikibase, Protegi, ELK Reasoner - important tools
5. Challenges
    * Ontology maintance and reuse: costly, complex
    * Linked data integration: shallow schemas, inconsistent interlink
    * Knowledge graphs: often closed(controlled by industry company)
    * Tool fragementation: lack of consolidated workflow accross RDF, OWL and SPARQL Tools
    * Need for consolidation
