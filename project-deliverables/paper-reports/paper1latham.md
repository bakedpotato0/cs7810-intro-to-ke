### Summary
This paper from 2001 is an outline of the concept of the Semantic Web in a near future context. The introductory narrative foreshadows Internet of Things connectivity, automation, and communication and coordination between different systems and services.
The Semantic Web is then presented as the way to bring these technologies into reality.  The Semantic Web would be built on top of the existing World Wide Web, and introduce connectivity and features that would greatly expand its utility.
Some of the technologies that will be used to build and expand the Semantic Web are Resource Description Framework (RDF), eXtensible Markup Language, Universal Resourse Identifiers (URIs), ontologies, and agents.

### Key Takeaways
1. RDF can use XML and URIs to encode meaning, so that computer systems can understand human concepts enough to make useful connections.
2. Ontologies bind concepts logically, and from there create more (indirect) connections and nested assumptions, leading to increased utility of data and accessibility.
3. Agents are programs that collect data from different sources, process it, and present it in a common language to other agents or to humans for approval.

### Questions to Instructor
1. Which facets from this early concept of the Semantic Web are still applicable today, and why?
2. Which facets from this early concept have not yet come to fruition or have been abandoned, and why?
