## Report

### Summary
This paper is an overview of modern knowledge graphs. An inclusive definition of a knowledge graph is "a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world, whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent relations between these entities." Knowledge graphs are similar to NoSQL models, but can be navigated recursively through arbitrary-length paths in addition to standard relational operations. Data graphs form the foundation of knowledge graphs. SPARQL is one language proposed for querying knowledge graphs. Regular path queries can be combined with other operators to create complex navigational graph patterns. A Closed World Assumption may change with the addition of new information, but under Open World Assumption, false statements remain false even when new information is added. There is also the Local Closed World Assumption, which assumes that parts of the graph are complete while others remain open.
