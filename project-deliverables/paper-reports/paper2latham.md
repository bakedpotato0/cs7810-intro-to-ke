### Summary
This article is a review of Semantic Web research from the publishing of *The Semantic Web* in Scientic American up to 2021.  As of the article's publication, the Semantic Web is has not been fully realized as a system, but is an ongoing field of research.
Different views of what the Semantic Web should be are presented, including the original view as an enhanced World Wide Web, a separate entity, or strictly a field of study into ontologies, linked data, and knowledge graphs using RDF, OWL, and SPARQL.
DARPA and the EU created Semantic Web language programs in the early 2000s whose products were later merged to become Web Ontology Language (OWL) under the banner of the W3C.  American research since then has been mostly focused on healthcare and defense applications,
while European research has been more foundational, and the field overall is more popular in Europe.  Linked data has greatly increased since the early 2000s, but most companies are only concerned with internal management of their own data and not freely accessible data.
Google introduced their Knowledge Graph in 2012, which allows related items to be retrieved. Knowledge graphs are more internally consistent than the Linked Data Cloud due to tighter controls. Natural language processing, machine learning, IoT technologies,
and the life sciences are some of the fields being developed with Semantic Web concepts. However, the ultimate incarnation of the Semantic Web as a singular system or a full collection of truly useful technologies has not yet been achieved.

### Key Takeaways
1. Most companies are only interested in using Semantic Web technologies to manage their own data internally.
2. There is still a lot of openly-accessible data online, but not all of it is well connected or processed.
3. Google's Knowledge Graph API can be downloaded, but not the Knowledge Graph itself.

### Questions to Instructor
1. How can we reconcile the academic research with industry applications?
2. Have there been any more major developments in Semantic Web research since this article was published in 2021?
