# Build the Use-case
1. Create a file called `use-case.md` from the [template](../templates/use-case.md).
2. Fill the `Narrative` section with a top-level description of your use-case, including references. As a guideline, this section should be about 500 words. This should, at a minimum, answer the questions:
    * Who are you supporting?
    * What are their goals?
    * Why is making a Knowledge Graph interesting -- or important -- for the use-case? 
    * Why a knowledge graph and not a relational (tabular) database?
3. Fill the `Competency Questions` section with no fewer than 10 competency questions. Thoroughly describe your intended interactions and what data will be retrieved to support said interactions.
4. Fill the `Potential Datasets` section with links and access dates for no less than five potential datasets.
5. Fill the `Existing Resources` section with any resources (e.g., ontologies, knowledge graphs, or standards) which can be used in the project.
6. Provide all references in the `References` section. References should be numbered starting at 1, listed in order of appearance, and otherwise following the IEEE reference style. Ensure that the DOI is included for every reference, where available.

**Note:** Ensure that each member contributes in explicit commits. Do not squash commits; the `git` history will serve as a record of participation and contribution.

# Use Case
## Narrative
Life expectancy is a measure that reflects the average number of years that a human is expected to live based on a variety of diverse factors. Generally, life expectancy is used to judge the average health of a society.
In addition to genetic predispositions, life expectancy is greatly influenced by a combination of environmental, social, and behavioral influences.
Across the state of Ohio, as in many parts of the United States, significant disparities in life expectancy may exist between different counties, ZIP codes, and even neighborhoods.
This presents an opportunity to better understand and address the root causes of these variations through a data-driven approach.
Our primary objective is to develop a knowledge graph model that estimates life expectancy for residents of all Ohio counties by integrating a wide range of datasets. The model will incorporate environmental data such as water quality and pollution.
These environmental exposures have been directly linked to serious medical issues, such as respiratory issues and various forms of cancer, and all of which negatively affect longevity.
