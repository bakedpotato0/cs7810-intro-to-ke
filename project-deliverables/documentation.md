# Create Documentation
This deliverable has two components: the documentation file and the presentation.

## Documentation
1. Create a file named `documentation.md` using the [template](../templates/documentation.md) and place it in the `deliverables` directory.
2. Adapt the sections from the previous project deliverables. There is additional guidance in the template.
    * The modules section should have one section per module (i.e., effectively each key notion).
    * The overview section should contain the overall schema diagram.

## Presentation
1. Create a presentation version of the documentation file.
    * Consider using [marp](https://marp.app/).
3. Add an additional section at the end called "Retrospective".
    * In this section, put 1-2 comments per group member
    * Include comments re: what went will in this course, what could be changed
    * Provide an overall rating for the course: fun/!fun, useful/!useful, etc.
4. Upload a PDF rendering of the presentation to the `deliverables` directory.

**Note:** Ensure that each member contributes in explicit commits. Do not squash commits; the `git` history will serve as a record of participation and contribution.
