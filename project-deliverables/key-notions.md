# Identify Key Notions
1. Create a `key-notions.md` file from the `key-notions.md` [template](../templates/key-notions.md) and place it in the `deliverables` directory.
2. Identify a thorough list of key notions. 
    * For each key notion, explain the rationale of why it is a key notion.
    * For each key notion or set of key notions, identify a pattern which can be used to model them, otherwise indicate that there is no existing pattern.
        * Draft an instantiation of the pattern (a module) based on the use-case, where possible.
        * For key notions with no pattern, draft a module which would model them.
    * Connect the key notion to where the data is coming from. For example, if an `Event` is a key notion, which piece of the identified datasets are used to populate the module.
        * Occasionally there will be _controlled vocabularies_. These are not technically patterns, but are a list of individuals that are important (and will not change). Indicate which key notions behave as such and their list of individuals.

**Note:** Ensure that each member contributes in explicit commits. Do not squash commits; the `git` history will serve as a record of participation and contribution.
