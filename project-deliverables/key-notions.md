# Identify Key Notions
1. Create a `key-notions.md` file from the `key-notions.md` [template](../templates/key-notions.md) and place it in the `deliverables` directory.
2. Identify a thorough list of key notions. 
    * For each key notion, explain the rationale of why it is a key notion.
    * For each key notion or set of key notions, identify a pattern which can be used to model them, otherwise indicate that there is no existing pattern.
        * Draft an instantiation of the pattern (a module) based on the use-case, where possible.
        * For key notions with no pattern, draft a module which would model them.
    * Connect the key notion to where the data is coming from. For example, if an `Event` is a key notion, which piece of the identified datasets are used to populate the module.
        * Occasionally there will be _controlled vocabularies_. These are not technically patterns, but are a list of individuals that are important (and will not change). Indicate which key notions behave as such and their list of individuals.

**Note:** Ensure that each member contributes in explicit commits. Do not squash commits; the `git` history will serve as a record of participation and contribution.


# Key Notions

* There is a racial attribute to health outcomes.
    * Rationale: African-Americans tend to have higher rates of diabetes and higher blood pressure, while Latinos tend to have lower rates of diabetes, and white people tend to have higher cholesterol and higher rates of skin cancer.  Social and racial factors are often interconnected, and non-white ethnicities tend to have poorer health outcomes.
    * Connected Pattern: pattern name (pattern source)
    * Source Dataset(s): BRFSS annual report, dataset n+1
* There is an interconnected wealth and educational attribute to health outcomes
    * Rationale: Higher education and wealth feed into each other, and higher wealth increases access to healthcare, including mental healthcare.  Higher education leads to avoidance of some behavioral risks.
    * Connected Pattern: pattern name (pattern source)
    * Source Dataset(s): BRFSS annual report, dataset n+1
* 
    * Rationale: H
    * Connected Pattern: pattern name (pattern source)
    * Source Dataset(s): dataset n, dataset n+1
