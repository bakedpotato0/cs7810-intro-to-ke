# Key Notions

* There is a racial attribute to health outcomes.
    * Rationale: African-Americans tend to have higher rates of diabetes and higher blood pressure, while Latinos tend to have lower rates of diabetes, and white people tend to have higher cholesterol and higher rates of skin cancer.  Social and racial factors are often interconnected, and non-white ethnicities tend to have poorer health outcomes.
    * Connected Pattern: Reporting Event
    * Source Dataset(s): BRFSS annual report, Bridged Race Population Data, Behavioral Health Claims Dashboard, Infectious Disease Dashboard, Mortality
* There is an interconnected wealth and educational attribute to health outcomes.
    * Rationale: Higher education and wealth feed into each other, and higher wealth increases access to healthcare, including mental healthcare.  Higher education leads to avoidance of some behavioral risks.
    * Connected Pattern: Reporting Event
    * Source Dataset(s): BRFSS annual report, Behavioral Health Claims Dashboard, Hospital Registration, Mortality
* There are pharmacy-access and hospital-access attributes to health outcomes.
    * Rationale: Taking medication as-prescribed by a healthcare professional improves health. "Self-medication" often diminishes health.
    * Connected Pattern: Reporting Event
    * Source Dataset(s): Respiratory Dashboard, Infectious Disease Dashboard, Behavioral Health Claims Dashboard, Hospital Registration, Mortality
* Health outcomes are events that have a direct impact on the quality and longevity of a person’s life, and stem from a multitude of factors.
    * Rationale: A series of health-related events can end a person’s life, or prolong it.
    * Connected Pattern: Recurring Event
    * Source Dataset(s): Behavioral Health Claims Dashboard, Cancer and Statistics, Hospital Registration Information, Infant Mortality Scorecard, Mortality, ODH Respiratory Dashboard, Ohio BRFSS Annual Report, Ohio BRFSS Data, Summary of Infectious Diseases in Ohio
* Negative health outcomes range in severity.
    * Rationale: Some outcomes can be treated while others cannot.
    * Connected Pattern: Recurring Event
    * Source Dataset(s): Behavioral Health Claims Dashboard, Cancer and Statistics, Hospital Registration Information, Infant Mortality Scorecard, Mortality, ODH Respiratory Dashboard, Ohio BRFSS Annual Report, Ohio BRFSS Data, Summary of Infectious Diseases in Ohio
* Positive health outcomes improve longevity.
    * Rationale: Discharge from a hospital to home means that a patient has survived a health event.
    * Connected Pattern: Recurring Event
    * Source Dataset(s): Hospital Registration, Best Hospitals in Ohio, Cancer Data and Statistics
* Key behaviors (i.e. Smoking, Vaccination, alcohol, exercises) affect health outcome
    * Rationale: Behaviors which are known risk factors can be tracked.
    * Connected Pattern: Reporting Event
    * Source Dataset(s): eCigarette Use, Ohio BRFSS Annual Report, Ohio BRFSS Data, Tobacco Use
* Healthcare Access Impact
    * Rationale: Accessibility to pharmacies and hospitals significantly impacts health outcomes.
    * Connected pattern: Reporting Event
    * Source Dataset(s): Best Hospitals in Ohio, Hospital Registration Information, National DPP Locator Map, Ohio Pharmacy Access
* Location is a large determinant of Health Outcomes
    * Rationale: where a person is located determines a number of social, environmental, and economic factors that affect health outcomes.
    * Connected Pattern: Reporting Event
    * Source Dataset(s): 2023 Ohio BRFSS Regions
* Environment is a factor that affects Health Outcomes
    * Rationale: Environmental factors like water cleanliness and air quality have a direct impact on health outcomes
    * Connected Pattern: Reporting Event
    * Source Dataset(s): Blood Lead Levels Public
* A person is the smallest unit to be studied, and is used to tie most of the other the modules together.
    * Rationale: A person is a human who is or was alive, and all the experiences and events that happened to them during that period.
    * Connected Pattern: Agent
* A population is the next unit above person.
    * Rationale: A population is a number of persons in a given location.
