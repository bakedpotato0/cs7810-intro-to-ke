# Key Notions

* There is a racial attribute to health outcomes.
    * Rationale: African-Americans tend to have higher rates of diabetes and higher blood pressure, while Latinos tend to have lower rates of diabetes, and white people tend to have higher cholesterol and higher rates of skin cancer.  Social and racial factors are often interconnected, and non-white ethnicities tend to have poorer health outcomes.
    * Connected Pattern: pattern name (pattern source)
    * Source Dataset(s): BRFSS annual report, Bridged Race Population Data, Behavioral Health Claims Dashboard, Infectious Disease Dashboard, Mortality
* There is an interconnected wealth and educational attribute to health outcomes.
    * Rationale: Higher education and wealth feed into each other, and higher wealth increases access to healthcare, including mental healthcare.  Higher education leads to avoidance of some behavioral risks.
    * Connected Pattern: pattern name (pattern source)
    * Source Dataset(s): BRFSS annual report, Behavioral Health Claims Dashboard, Hospital Registration, Mortality
* There are pharmacy-access and hospital-access attributes to health outcomes.
    * Rationale: Taking medication as-prescribed by a healthcare professional improves health. "Self-medication" often diminishes health.

    * Source Dataset(s): Respiratory Dashboard, Infectious Disease Dashboard, Behavioral Health Claims Dashboard, Hospital Registration, Mortality
* Health outcomes are events that have a direct impact on the quality and longevity of a person’s life, and stem from a multitude of factors.
    * Rationale: A series of health-related events can end a person’s life, or prolong it.
