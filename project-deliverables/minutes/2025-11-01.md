* Agenda
    * Team meeting over Discord
    * Work on Schema Diagrams

    * Collaborating on yED isn't easy.  Figma and draw.io are easier but less geared toward the desired format.
    * We have a first draft of the overall schema uploaded now.
* Action Items
    * Keep working on Schema Diagrams.  They need to be finished by Thursday.
